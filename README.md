Game project worked during our Programming III final.

Explore a space station, escaping from a monster, collect all notes and escape. Our first attempt at making a game of a bigger scale,
We learned the importance of proper file structures, having a clear understanding of programming patterns, flexibility, and how to properly 
define the scope of our game.
